Item 2.    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This Item and other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, in each case under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.
Unless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2023 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.
Available Information
The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and governance matters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.
Business Seasonality and Product Introductions
The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.
During the third quarter of 2024, the Company announced the following product and operating system updates:
•iPad Air®;
•iPad Pro®;
•iOS 18, macOS® Sequoia, iPadOS® 18, watchOS® 11, visionOS™ 2 and tvOS® 18.
The Company also announced Apple Intelligence™, a personal intelligence system that uses generative models, which will be available on certain iPhone, Mac and iPad devices. Apple Intelligence is deeply integrated into iOS 18, macOS Sequoia and iPadOS 18.
Fiscal Period
The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2024 and 2023 span 52 and 53 weeks, respectively.
Macroeconomic Conditions
Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.

The Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.
The Company’s contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2023 Form 10-K, except for manufacturing purchase obligations.
Manufacturing Purchase Obligations
The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of June 29, 2024, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $38.4 billion, with $38.3 billion payable within 12 months.
Capital Return Program
In addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has authorized share repurchase programs. The programs do not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of June 29, 2024, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.25 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.
During the third quarter of 2024, the Company repurchased $26.0 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.9 billion.
