Item 2.    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
This section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021 (the “2021 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.
Unless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the “Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2021 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.
Available Information
The Company periodically provides certain information for investors on its corporate website, www.apple.com, and its investor relations website, investor.apple.com. This includes press releases and other information about financial performance, information on environmental, social and corporate governance matters, and details related to the Company’s annual meeting of shareholders. The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company’s references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only.
Business Seasonality and Product Introductions
The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.
Quarterly Highlights
Total net sales increased 9% or $7.7 billion during the second quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter in 2021, driven primarily by growth in Services, iPhone and Mac.
During the second quarter of 2022, the Company released the following products:
•iPhone SE® with 5G technology;
•iPad Air®, powered by the Apple M1 chip;
•All-new Mac Studio™, powered by the Apple M1 Max or the new Apple M1 Ultra chip; and
•All-new Apple Studio Display™.
The Company repurchased $22.9 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.6 billion during the second quarter of 2022.

COVID-19 Update
The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and continues to have, a significant impact around the world, prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures, such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantine and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as the price of the Company’s stock.
During the second quarter of 2022, aspects of the Company’s business continued to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a significant number of the Company’s employees working remotely and many of the Company’s retail stores operating at limited capacity or temporarily closing at various times. Substantially all of the Company’s other facilities are open, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees. The Company continues to work on safely reopening the remainder of its facilities, subject to local rules and regulations.
At times, certain of the Company’s outsourcing partners, component suppliers and logistical service providers have experienced disruptions, resulting in supply shortages that could affect sales worldwide. Similar disruptions could occur in the future.
The extent of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance is uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the development, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments, the imposition of protective public safety measures, and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products. Refer to Part I, Item 1A of the 2021 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors” for more information.

Research and Development
The growth in research and development (“R&D”) expense during the second quarter and first six months of 2022 compared to the same periods in 2021 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses, engineering program costs and professional services. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the Company’s core business strategy.
Selling, General and Administrative
The growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2021 was driven primarily by increases in advertising, headcount-related expenses and professional services. Year-over-year selling, general and administrative expense increased during the first six months of 2022 due primarily to increases in headcount-related expenses, advertising and variable selling expenses.

The Company’s effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, including the favorable impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by the impact to U.S. foreign tax credits as a result of regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in January 2022 (the “Regulations”). The Company’s effective tax rate for the first six months of 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, including the favorable impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits.
The Company’s effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2022 was higher compared to the second quarter of 2021 due primarily to the impact to U.S. foreign tax credits as a result of the Regulations, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, including the favorable impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first six months of 2022 was higher compared to the same period in 2021 due primarily to the impact to U.S. foreign tax credits as a result of the Regulations and lower tax benefits from share-based compensation.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond.
The Company’s contractual cash requirements have not changed materially since the 2021 Form 10-K, except for manufacturing purchase obligations.
Manufacturing Purchase Obligations
The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. As of March 26, 2022, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $40.6 billion, with $40.5 billion payable within 12 months. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable.
In addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has a share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors (the “Program”). As of March 26, 2022, the remaining availability under the Program was $17.6 billion. On April 28, 2022, the Company announced the Board of Directors increased the Program authorization by $90 billion. The Program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares.
On April 28, 2022, the Company also announced the Board of Directors raised the Company’s quarterly cash dividend from $0.22 to $0.23 per share, beginning with the dividend to be paid during the third quarter of 2022. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to condensed consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2021 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates since the 2021 Form 10-K.
