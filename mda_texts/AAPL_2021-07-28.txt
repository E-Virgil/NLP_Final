This section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 26, 2020 (the “2020 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.
Unless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the “Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2020 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.

Quarterly Highlights
Business Seasonality and Product Introductions
The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.
COVID-19 Update
The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures, such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.
During the third quarter of 2021, aspects of the Company’s business continued to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many of the Company’s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, temporarily closed at various times, and a significant number of the Company’s employees working remotely. The Company has reopened substantially all of its offices and retail stores, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers, and it continues to work on safely reopening the remainder of its offices and retail stores, subject to local rules and regulations.
The extent of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance is uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic; the availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines; the imposition of protective public safety measures; and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products. Refer to Part I, Item 1A of the 2020 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors,” for more information.

Research and Development
The growth in research and development (“R&D”) expense during the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses, and material and equipment costs. Year-over-year R&D expense increased during the first nine months of 2021 due primarily to higher headcount-related expenses and R&D-related professional services. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products and services that are central to the Company’s core business strategy. 
Selling, General and Administrative
The growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related and advertising expenses. Year-over-year selling, general and administrative expense increased during the first nine months of 2021 due primarily to higher headcount-related and variable selling expenses.

OI&E increased during the third quarter of 2021 compared to the third quarter of 2020 due primarily to a favorable carrying value adjustment of non-marketable securities and smaller impairments of securities, partially offset by lower interest income. Year-over-year OI&E increased during the first nine months of 2021 due primarily to smaller impairments of securities, lower interest expense and favorable carrying value adjustments of non-marketable securities, partially offset by lower interest income.
The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.32% and 1.74% in the third quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively, and 1.40% and 1.95% in the first nine months of 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of 2021 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective rate on foreign earnings, tax benefits from share-based compensation, and the favorable impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by state income taxes.
The Company’s effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021 was lower compared to the third quarter of 2020 due primarily to the favorable impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits, a higher mix of foreign earnings, and higher tax benefits from share-based compensation. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2021 was lower compared to the same period in 2020 due primarily to higher tax benefits from share-based compensation, the favorable impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits, and a higher mix of foreign earnings, partially offset by a one-time adjustment in 2020 of U.S. foreign tax credits in response to regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in December 2019.

The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers.

Other Non-Current Liabilities
The Company’s remaining other non-current liabilities primarily consist of items for which the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing or amount of payments.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material.
Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2020 Form 10-K, and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Part II, Item 7 of the 2020 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.

(1)As of June 26, 2021, the Company was authorized to purchase up to $315 billion of the Company’s common stock under the Program, announced on April 28, 2021, of which $234.1 billion had been utilized. The remaining $80.9 billion in the table represents the amount available to repurchase shares under the Program as of June 26, 2021. The Program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the Program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act.
(2)In May 2021, the Company entered into a new ASR. Under the terms of the agreement, a financial institution committed to deliver shares of the Company’s stock during the purchase period in exchange for an up-front payment of $5.0 billion. The total number of shares ultimately delivered under the ASR, and therefore the average repurchase price paid per share, is determined based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock during the ASR’s purchase period, which will end in or before August 2021.
