This section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as “future,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “will,” “would,” “could,” “can,” “may,” and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company’s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 26, 2020 (the “2020 Form 10-K”) under the heading “Risk Factors.” The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.
Unless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company’s fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Each of the terms the “Company” and “Apple” as used herein refers collectively to Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated.
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the 2020 Form 10-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q.

Quarterly Highlights
Business Seasonality and Product Introductions
The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.
COVID-19 Update
The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures, such as restrictions on travel and business operations, temporary closures of businesses, and quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly curtailed global economic activity and caused significant volatility and disruption in global financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by many countries in response have affected and could in the future materially impact the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.
During the second quarter of 2021, aspects of the Company’s business continued to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many of the Company’s retail stores, as well as channel partner points of sale, temporarily closed at various times, and the vast majority of the Company’s employees working remotely. The Company has reopened some of its offices and retail stores, subject to operating restrictions to protect public health and the health and safety of employees and customers, and it continues to work on safely reopening the remainder of its offices and retail stores, subject to local rules and regulations.
The full extent of the future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factors outside the Company’s control, including, without limitation, the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic; the availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines; the imposition of protective public safety measures; and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and demand for consumer products. Refer to Part I, Item 1A of the 2020 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors,” for more information.

Second Quarter Fiscal 2021 Highlights

Research and Development
The growth in research and development (“R&D”) expense during the second quarter and first six months of 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses.

Selling, General and Administrative
The growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the second quarter and first six months of 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses and higher variable selling expenses.

OI&E increased during the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020 due primarily to impairments of marketable and non-marketable securities in 2020 and a favorable carrying value adjustment of non-marketable securities in 2021, partially offset by lower interest income in 2021.
OI&E decreased during the first six months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 due primarily to lower interest income in 2021, partially offset by impairments of marketable and non-marketable securities in 2020 and lower interest expense in 2021.
The weighted-average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.37% and 2.01% in the second quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively, and 1.43% and 2.05% in the first six months of 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The Company’s effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2021 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to lower taxes on foreign earnings. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first six months of 2021 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to lower taxes on foreign earnings and tax benefits from share-based compensation.
The Company’s effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2021 was higher compared to the second quarter of 2020 due primarily to higher taxes on foreign earnings and a lower impact of the U.S. federal R&D tax credit. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first six months of 2021 was higher compared to the same period in 2020 due primarily to higher taxes on foreign earnings, partially offset by higher tax benefits from share-based compensation.

Other Non-Current Liabilities
The Company’s remaining other non-current liabilities primarily consist of items for which the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing or amount of payments.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and such differences may be material.
Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2020 Form 10-K, and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in Part II, Item 7 of the 2020 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.
